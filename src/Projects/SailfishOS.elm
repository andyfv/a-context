As with most case studies, the idea is to explore the current state of a particular area and make some propositions about improving it.

And the area of this case study is the UX of Sailfish OS(which is already pretty good). Of course, the proposed ideas shouldn't be too harsh and drive away the current users.

<hr>

First, let's talk context. We have to deal with multiple contexts. So let's find the borders/limitations we have to work with.
